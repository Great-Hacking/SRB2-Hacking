# Coming Up Hacks
``ECHClient`` --- Not a hack, but it can hack if you edit values. For the pro(free) version, you can change rings, speed and lives. To get the pro version, you have to win it or contact me. You would be approved or disaproved.

``Speed Editor`` --- You can see a preview in the SRB2 Hacking server. Currently open in that server.
